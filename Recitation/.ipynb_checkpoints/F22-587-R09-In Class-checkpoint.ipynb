    "During L26, we considered the idea that a reactor-with-recycle process could be used to attain high overall (process-level) conversion for reactions that are somehow limited to low single pass (once through the reactor) conversion.  The scenario we considered in class was an equilibrium-limited reaction (propane dehydrogenation), but reactor-with-recycle schemes can also be used to improve overall yields when dealing with sequential reactions.  Specifically, it allows one to operate the reactor at relatively low single-pass conversion to avoid secondary reactions, but it recycles the remainder to allow a high overall conversion."
